## Overview of Statistical Analysis
The purpose for this project was analyzing bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for investors interested in beginning a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. While Iowa cannot compare to the fast-paced life of NYC, this analysis might help answer a few key questions:
- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?
- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders?
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

## Results

The number of trips by duration shows the majority of CitiBikes rides last less than an hour. Most trips are under a half-hour, with a dropoff in the number of rides over an hour in length.

This breakdown of the number of rides by duration by gender shows that males are the primary riders of Citibikes in NYC.

The heatmap displays weekly usage rider patterns. We see the most bike usage during weekday commute times around 8am and 5-6pm, and weekend usage is spread throughout the middle of the day. An outlier is the relatively low bike usage during Wednesday's end-of-day commute.

The heatmap based on gender shows relatively similar riding patterns between men and women.

This heatmap of customers compared with subscribers reinforces how much of the userbase is comprised of male subscribing users.
