## Overview of Statistical Analysis
The purpose for this project was analyzing bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for investors interested in beginning a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. While Iowa cannot compare to the fast-paced life of NYC, this analysis might help answer a few key questions:
- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?
- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders?
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

## Results
